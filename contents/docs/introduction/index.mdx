## Computer Fundamentals
Master essential computer skills for developers - from file management to system navigation and understanding file types
keywords: 
  - file system
  - folders
  - file extensions
  - computer basics
  - developer fundamentals
  - system navigation

## Basic Computer Operations

### Navigating Your OS
- Windows/Mac/Linux interface fundamentals
- Using mouse vs keyboard navigation
- Common keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Win+E` / `Cmd+Space` (File Explorer/Spotlight)
  - `Ctrl+C` / `Cmd+C` (Copy)
  - `Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V` (Paste)

### Files and Folders Management
```text
üìÅ Documents/
‚îú‚îÄ üìÅ Projects/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ üìÑ report.txt
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ üìÅ images/
‚îî‚îÄ üìÅ Downloads/
   ‚îî‚îÄ üìÑ setup.exe
```

- Creating/moving/deleting files
- Organizational best practices:
  - Clear naming conventions (`project_v2_final_REAL`)
  - Logical folder hierarchy
  - Regular backups

<Note type="warning">
  Always check file paths before deleting - system files are often hidden!
</Note>

### File Types and Extensions
| Category | Examples       | Purpose                     |
|----------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Text     | .txt, .md      | Unformatted text documents  |
| Code     | .js, .html     | Programming source files    |
| Media    | .jpg, .mp4     | Images, videos, audio       |
| Archives | .zip, .tar     | Compressed file bundles     |

Key concepts:
- Extension determines file association (.html opens in browser)
- Hidden files (e.g., .gitignore, .env)
- Executable warnings (.exe, .sh, .bat)

## Why Start with HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the backbone of all web content. As a markup language rather than a programming language, it provides an accessible entry point to:

- Understand content structure
- Learn element hierarchy
- Practice semantic organization
- Prepare for CSS styling
- Transition to dynamic content

## HTML Programming Guide

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage. Here are some key concepts and examples:

### HTML Elements

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are represented by tags. Here's an example of a simple HTML element:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

### HTML Attributes

HTML attributes provide additional information about elements. They are always included in the opening tag. Here's an example:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

### HTML Forms

HTML forms are used to collect user input. Here's an example of a simple HTML form:

```html
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

## JavaScript Programming Guide

JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. Here are some key concepts and examples:

### JavaScript Variables

Variables are used to store data values. Here's an example of how to declare a variable in JavaScript:

```javascript
let message = "Hello, World!";
```

### JavaScript Functions

Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. Here's an example of a simple function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}
```

### JavaScript Event Listeners

Event listeners allow you to run code in response to events. Here's an example of adding an event listener to a button:

```html
<button id="myButton">Click Me</button>

<script>
  document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
  });
</script>
```

## React Programming Guide

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable components and manage the state of your application. Here are some key concepts and examples:

### React Components

React components are the building blocks of a React application. Here's an example of a simple React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### React State Management

React provides a way to manage the state of your application using hooks. Here's an example of a component with state:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
