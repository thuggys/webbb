## Computer Fundamentals
Master essential computer skills for developers - from file management to system navigation and understanding file types
keywords: 
  - file system
  - folders
  - file extensions
  - computer basics
  - developer fundamentals
  - system navigation
---

## Basic Computer Operations

### Navigating Your OS
- Windows/Mac/Linux interface fundamentals
- Using mouse vs keyboard navigation
- Common keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Win+E` / `Cmd+Space` (File Explorer/Spotlight)
  - `Ctrl+C` / `Cmd+C` (Copy)
  - `Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V` (Paste)

### Files and Folders Management
```text
📁 Documents/
├─ 📁 Projects/
│  ├─ 📄 report.txt
│  └─ 📁 images/
└─ 📁 Downloads/
   └─ 📄 setup.exe
```

- Creating/moving/deleting files
- Organizational best practices:
  - Clear naming conventions (`project_v2_final_REAL`)
  - Logical folder hierarchy
  - Regular backups

<Note type="warning">
  Always check file paths before deleting - system files are often hidden!
</Note>

### File Types and Extensions
| Category | Examples       | Purpose                     |
|----------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Text     | .txt, .md      | Unformatted text documents  |
| Code     | .js, .html     | Programming source files    |
| Media    | .jpg, .mp4     | Images, videos, audio       |
| Archives | .zip, .tar     | Compressed file bundles     |

Key concepts:
- Extension determines file association (.html opens in browser)
- Hidden files (e.g., .gitignore, .env)
- Executable warnings (.exe, .sh, .bat)

2. **Development Environment**: Setting up and customizing your IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
3. **First Steps with HTML**: Learn the markup language that structures all web content

<Note type="tip">
  **Hands-On Approach:** We recommend practicing each concept as you learn. Web development skills are best acquired through active experimentation - don't hesitate to break things and fix them!

## Why Start with HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the backbone of all web content. As a markup language rather than a programming language, it provides an accessible entry point to:

- Understand content structure
- Learn element hierarchy
- Practice semantic organization
- Prepare for CSS styling
- Transition to dynamic content
