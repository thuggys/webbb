# Interactive Features

Our documentation platform includes several interactive features to enhance your learning experience. This section will guide you through the usage of interactive quizzes.

## Interactive Quizzes

Interactive quizzes allow you to test your knowledge on various topics. Here's an example of how to use the `Quiz` component:

```jsx
import Quiz from "@/components/interactive/quiz";

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What is React?",
    options: ["Library", "Framework", "Language"],
    correctAnswer: "Library"
  },
  {
    question: "What is JSX?",
    options: ["JavaScript XML", "JavaScript Extension", "Java Syntax"],
    correctAnswer: "JavaScript XML"
  }
]} />
```

## Interactive Features using HTML

HTML provides the foundation for creating interactive features on web pages. Here are some examples:

### HTML Forms

HTML forms allow users to input data and interact with your web application. Here's an example of a simple HTML form:

```html
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

### HTML Buttons

HTML buttons can be used to trigger actions or events. Here's an example of a button that displays an alert when clicked:

```html
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
```

## Interactive Features using JavaScript

JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. Here are some examples:

### JavaScript Event Listeners

Event listeners allow you to respond to user actions, such as clicks or key presses. Here's an example of adding an event listener to a button:

```html
<button id="myButton">Click Me</button>

<script>
  document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
  });
</script>
```

### JavaScript DOM Manipulation

JavaScript can be used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and update the content of a web page. Here's an example of changing the text of a paragraph:

```html
<p id="myParagraph">Original text</p>
<button onclick="changeText()">Change Text</button>

<script>
  function changeText() {
    document.getElementById("myParagraph").innerText = "Text has been changed!";
  }
</script>
```

## Interactive Features using React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable components and manage the state of your application. Here are some examples:

### React Components

React components are the building blocks of a React application. Here's an example of a simple React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### React State Management

React provides a way to manage the state of your application using hooks. Here's an example of a component with state:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
