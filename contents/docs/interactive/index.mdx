# Interactive Features

Our documentation platform includes several interactive features to enhance your learning experience. This section will guide you through the usage of interactive quizzes and code editors.

## Interactive Quizzes

Interactive quizzes allow you to test your knowledge on various topics. Here's an example of how to use the `Quiz` component:

```jsx
import Quiz from "@/components/interactive/quiz";

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What is React?",
    options: ["Library", "Framework", "Language"],
    correctAnswer: "Library"
  },
  {
    question: "What is JSX?",
    options: ["JavaScript XML", "JavaScript Extension", "Java Syntax"],
    correctAnswer: "JavaScript XML"
  }
]} />
```

## Interactive Code Editor

The interactive code editor allows you to write and run code directly within the documentation. Here's an example of how to use the `CodeEditor` component:

```jsx
import CodeEditor from "@/components/interactive/code-editor";

<CodeEditor />
```

These interactive components are designed to make your learning experience more engaging and effective. Feel free to explore and use them in your own documentation.
